 I read an article this morning about a topic that fascinates me: North Korea. It's eerie, and has been so since I was a little kid. 
Anyhow - North Korea is infiltrating IT departments in the US. One DPRK spy had passed two federal background checks, and came out clean. Another eerie detail: the NK spy wired 90% of his earnings back to the Fatherland.

This on top of the fact that in the past few weeks, the DPRK has been targeting US power grids, and have initiated a campaign of ransomeware toward hospitals. Little kids die when people attack hospitals. And that's why these bastards have to be stopped.
Something every American can get behind.
