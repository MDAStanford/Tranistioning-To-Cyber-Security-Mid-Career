 I read an article this morning about a topic that fascinates me: North Korea. It's eerie, and has been so since I was a little kid. 
North Korea is infiltrating IT departments in the US. One DPRK spy passed two federal background checks, and came out clean. Another eerie detail: the NK spy wired 90% of his earnings back to the Fatherland. 

This on top of the fact that in the past few weeks, the DPRK has been targeting US power grids, and have initiated a campaign of ransomeware toward hospitals. Little kids die when people attack hospitals. And that's why these bastards have to be stopped.
Something every American can get behind.

It's a thuggish regime that needs to be destroyed within my lifetime.

Prepping for the coming week:

MONDAY - Phone call with a FB friend that went to Lakeridge HS. He's friends with about 9 of my friends, so he passed my credability radar. He's been in CS for a while, and has quite a few contacts. I'll let him know - I want to build my network, and get plugged into a job as soon as possible. PM or anything entry level. Not picky.

TUESDAY - My calendar has a 10AM call with a recruiter, but the meeting request doesn't have any details. If anyone calls on Tuesday @ 10, I'll remember to take the call.

WEDNESDAY - Call with the UCLA Career Center. Interested to see how this goes. And...I was given Linked In+, good for nine months.

And...waiting for a response to a recruiter call that I had last week. It's a pet meds-on-demand concept, based in Portland.


My resume is getting a lot of attention right now: I've had a ton of recruiter interviews, a signifigant number of 2nd round interviews, and 4 third-round interviews. Getting plugged into the industry is tough, but that's a realistic expectation that the instructors set from the beginning. If this was easy, everyone would be doing it.

Study plan for the week:

1 - I have 120 saved jobs in the cue. My goal is to knock out half of these tonight, and the other half tomorrow. 
Weekly resume goal: 50 per day. They say it's useless to send out resumes blindly, but I disgree. This is a numbers game. Linked In is the best way to fill up my funnel quickly.

2 - Browse for LI Easy Apply jobs posted in the last 3 days. 

3 - source new leads

4 - Study for Security+ (two hours / trying for three hours a day). I need to find a tutoirial that doesn't put me to sleep. I need to get this ticked off my list ASAP, which should simplify my job search. 

5 - Pay some attention to Indeed.com. We've been leaning on Liked In pretty hard over the past few weeks.

6 - study group is kind of killing me, and I'm not sure it's helping me to prepare for the cert. But it has to be done. Need to get this scheduled for October 1, and if needed a re-take on November 1. 

7 - take one Sec+ test per night.
