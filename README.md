North Korea fascinates me. It's eerie, and has been so since I was a little kid. Sealed off from the rest of the world.
I've seen documentaries - little girls prepping for a synchronized stadium event in honor of Dear Leader. Propoganda piped into people's homes 24/7. Kidnapping Japanese nationals. And the creepiest: the Americans that defected to North Korea after the conflict in the 50's.

It's a thuggish regime that needs to be destroyed within my lifetime.

They're infiltrating IT departments in the US. One DPRK spy passed two federal background checks, and came out clean. Another eerie detail: the NK spy wired 90% of his earnings back to the Fatherland. 

This on top of the fact that in the past few weeks, the DPRK has been targeting US power grids, and have initiated a campaign of ransomeware toward hospitals. Little kids die when people attack hospitals. And that's why these bastards have to be stopped.
Something every sane person can get behind.

Prepping for the coming week:

MONDAY - Phone call with a FB friend that went to Lakeridge HS. He's friends with about 9 of my friends, so he passed my credability radar. He's been in CS for a while, and has quite a few contacts. I'll let him know - I want to build my network, and get plugged into a job as soon as possible. PM or anything entry level. Not picky.

TUESDAY - My calendar has a 10AM call with a recruiter, but the meeting request doesn't have any details. If anyone calls on Tuesday @ 10, I'll remember to take the call.

WEDNESDAY - Call with the UCLA Career Center. Interested to see how this goes. And...I was given Linked In+, good for nine months.

And...waiting for a response to a recruiter call that I had last week. It's a pet meds-on-demand concept, based in Portland. The initial recruiter call went well, but most of those calls go well. It's getting to the 2nd interview that matters right now.


My resume is getting a lot of attention: I've had a ton of recruiter interviews, a signifigant number of 2nd round interviews, and 4 third-round interviews. Getting plugged into the industry is tough, but that's a realistic expectation that the instructors set from the beginning. If this was easy, everyone would be doing it.

Study plan for the week:

1 - I have 120 saved jobs in the cue. My goal is to knock out half of these tonight, and the other half tomorrow. 
Weekly resume goal: 50 per day. They say it's useless to send out resumes blindly, but I disgree. This is a numbers game. Linked In is the best way to fill up my funnel quickly.

2 - Browse for LI Easy Apply jobs posted in the last 3 days. 

3 - source new leads

4 - Study for Security+ (two hours / trying for three hours a day). I need to find a tutoirial that doesn't put me to sleep. I need to get this ticked off my list ASAP, which should simplify my job search. 

5 - Pay some attention to Indeed.com. We've been leaning on Linked In pretty hard over the past few weeks.

6 - study group is kind of killing me, and I'm not sure it's helping me to prepare for the cert. But it has to be done. Need to get this scheduled for October 1, and if needed a re-take on November 1. 

7 - take one Sec+ practice test per night.

GEOFENCING: great read about geofencing and forsensics

  BLOG SPOT 4 / JULY 15 2022
  
  Week in review.
  
  *Spoke with Mike Daniels, from Lakeridge HS. We talked a lifetime ago @ a TKF show @ Key Largo, when he got home from being in Iraq during Desert Storm I. Great guy - had some interesting ideas to switch up my job search (adding healthcare into the mix). Mke was even cool enough to make a post on Linked In about my interest in enlarging my network. Established contacts, and spoke with Alex Guildlay @ Hertz.
  
  *Finally had a Zoom call with Irene @ the UCLA / bootcamp career center. She was impressed that I had booked so many interviews, and basically told me to keep doing whatever I was already doing. Also - received a few good tips on how to tweak my resume. 
  
  *Quick phone chat with a recruiter in the healthcare industry. Good advice - plenty of cyber-related jobs.
  *Blown off my a jr recruiter on Friday. First time in my search that's happened.

Fake job postings are a real thing. There has been an uptick recently of fake job postings being posted to reputable sites (LinkedIn, Indeed)

The article below outlines a few tips on identifying scams, but here are a few that I personally look out for:

 *email syntax: if something sounds 'off' in the phrasing of an email, we're not off to a great start. The emails sound the same as emails I exchanged with my counterparts in China during my time in apparel & footwear. Hard to describe, and it isn't necessarily a deal breaker, but it does activate my radar.
 
    *email addresses: hotmail / aol / yahoo / gmail...are all a sign of shenanigans. With Gmail, I give the sender a little leeway. Gmail is a solid and reliable tool.
    
    *typosquatting. Always reverse-engineer domain names. 
    
    *web presence: if you don't see anything about the company online, it's definitely a scam.
    
    *Even if the company has a decent-looking profile, I still look @ company profiles on LinkedIn and GlassDoor. Do your best to make sure the employee accounts aren't fake. 
    
    *Anything having to do with out-of-pocket expenses is a scam. Or a pyramid scheme. One scammer in Africa asked me to send over iPhones in order to grease the wheels of the Nigerian bureaucracy. 

    *Interviews done online, or on non-verbal apps (WhatsApp, Skype, etc)
    
    In terms of cyber security, I believe this aspect of due dilligence is fun.
    
   Keep your eyes open at all times.

 BLOG SPOT 5 / JULY 26 2022
 
 EMPLOYMENT AGENCIES: casting my net wide includes the use of employment agencies - different from HR or recruiters, the agencies assist new college grads and veterans to find employment. In exchange, the agency asks for 5% of earnings for a year, sometimes as much as 24 months.
 I've always been told that - generally speaking - these types of agencies should be avoided, and that any legitimate agency would be commissioned by the employer. But my research indicates that these agencies are a viable option in the job hunt.
 
 Here are my experiences with these agencies so far:
 
 *MONDAY* Had a very short call with Agency A. Turns out that the positions they have are hybrid, not remote as advertised. That's not a dealbreaker, but...there were no clients / projects in or around Los Angeles.
 
 *TUESDAY* Spoke with Agency B over Zoom. They won't help until I've earned my Security+ certification. And once I have my Sec+, there's a diminishd chance I would need this agency. 
    I'll stay in touch with the agency, but this isn't anything to hang my hat on.
    Also on Tuesday, I signed up with Agency C. Everything checked out in my due dillengce.
    
    I'm keeping an open mind, and will report back on Agency C.
    
BLOGSPOT 6 / AUGUST 2 2022

About me: I don't know why I jumped into this blog without giving my background information for context.
   I'm 56 years old, and originally from Portland OR. My career has included multiple roles in the athletic footwear and apparel industry - sourcing, logistics and then direct exposure to product, initially in development and then movong into product management.
   In 2007 I was recruited for a job in Los Angeles. Didn't know a soul, but for a bunch of reasons it was time to leave Portland. The rain was killing me (FYI: I'm a Pacific NW native, and used to the rain), there were rumors abvout re-organization / layoffs within the company, burn out, boredom. 
    Los Angeles has been good to me, with the exception of work opportunities. 
    
    Eventually I branched out on my own as a freelancer, and business was great. My client roster was awesome, and the work wasn't tough to find based on the network I had established in the apparel / footwear / accessories industry. And then business dried up. 
    I applied for multiple in-house positions, but came to the realization that I had (most likely) aged out of the industry. When you turn 50 in apparel, you either own a company or have reached upper-level positions. No one needs a 50 year old developer.
    Rather than wait around for jobs, I created my own business - BearFlag California. Long story, but I ran out of money for marketing. Without a marketing budget, selling product online is nearly impossible. My goal is to generate enough marketing budget to sell my inventory (pouches)
