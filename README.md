# Tranistioning-To-Cyber-Security-Mid-Career
The Adventures Of Mick Switching To Cyber Security


The purpose of this blog is catharsis, but if it helps someone - bonus. The first entries will be long, and I won't be offended if you want to skip this part but a good back story sets the blog up to succeed. Big picture.

So, who am I and how did I get here? Good questions that I'll cover briefly. I live in Santa Monica CA, and am origially from Portland OR.

SIDE NOTE #1: Timbers just beat Seattle 3-0. IN SEATTLE.
The Timbers are my team. They say you don't find your club, it finds you. So true. Win, lose or draw my heart has been with this team sincew 1977.

Long storty compacted: 

  *I live in Santa Monica CA
  *originally from Portland OR
  *earned a BA from Portland State University, which was recently ranked by US World & News Reprot as the most liberal university in the USA.
  *since leaving college, I've worked in the sporting goods industry. From sourcing to logistics to product development, a tiny amount of design and product management. 
  *I moved to the Los Angeles area in 2007
  *I worked for Generic-Business-Name for 3 years
  
  SIDE NOTE #2: No one gets trashed on this blog. I've worked a few places in my career - some good, some not-so-good. No sour grapes.
  
  *Went off on my own in 2013 because I had a couple of epic consulting contracts, and thought that running a business was easy. Until it wasn't. Many reasons I should have exited earlier, but I didn't.
