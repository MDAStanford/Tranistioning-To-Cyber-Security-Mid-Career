# Tranistioning-To-Cyber-Security-Mid-Career
The Adventures Of Mick Switching To Cyber Security


JULY 9 2022

The purpose of this blog is catharsis. If it helps someone - bonus. The first entries will be long, and I won't be offended if you skip this part, but a good back story sets my blog up to succeed. Thinking big picture.

So, who am I and how did I get here? Good questions that I'll cover briefly. 

 *I live in Santa Monica CA, and am origially from Portland OR.

SIDE NOTE #1: Timbers just beat Seattle 3-0. IN SEATTLE.
The Timbers are my team. They say you don't find your club, it finds you. So true. Win, lose or draw my heart has been with this team since 1977.

Long storty compacted: 

  *I live in Santa Monica CA
  *originally from Portland OR
  *earned a BA from Portland State University, which was recently ranked by US World & News Reprot as the most liberal university in the USA.
  *since leaving college, I've worked in the sporting goods industry. From sourcing to logistics to product development, a tiny amount of design and product management. 
  *I moved to the Los Angeles area in 2007
  *I worked for Generic-Business-Name for 3 years
  
  SIDE NOTE #2: No one gets trashed on this blog. I've worked a few places in my career - some good, some not-so-good. No sour grapes.
  
  *Went off on my own in 2013 because I had a couple of epic consulting contracts, and thought that running a business would be easy. Until it wasn't. Many reasons I should have exited this industry earlier, but I didn't. 
  
 *My wife suggested that I go back to school, which I would never have thought of in a million years.
 
 *I registered for UCLA's cyber security bootcamp, worked my butt off, and walked away with a 4.0 GPA.
   
  *We'll talk about the bootcamp and my experience in upcoming blog entries. 
  *Currently job-seeking, and in parrelell studying for Security+ as well as an AWS Cloud certification.
  
  And here we are. I graduated in March 2022 and am looking for the first foot-in-the-door within cyber security. And I'm totally not that picky:
  
   *My softest landing would be in product management. It's my background, albeit in Consumer Packaged Goods.
   
   *I'm also applying for entry level positions - SOC analyst, Help Desk and other positions that Linked In has labelled 'entry level'.
   
   ***REGARDING ENTRY LEVEL POSITIONS IN CYBER SECURITY***  You will run into entry level postings that want candidates  with 5 years of experience and certifications. It's frustrating AF, but it's just a fact of life for us to deal with. 
   
   *A few class-mates and I formed a study group for Security+. Im not 100% convinced that I'll continue. It's hard to think over people talking. I've turned down the volume on my computer, and am using Zoom annotations to select answers. We'll see how that progresses.
   
   For next week, I have 3 phone calls lined up. Two recruiters, and a Facebook friend from HS that has worked in the industry for a while.
   
   To this point I've had a ton of recruiter interviews, a decent number of 2nd interviews, and 3 third interviews. No offers yet.
   
   
   This is a good place to end BlogSpot #1.  Will update once per week.
